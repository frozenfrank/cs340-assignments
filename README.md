# ðŸ¦œ CS 340 Assignments

Class assignments and exercises for CS 340 Software Engineering.

This repo collects all of the non-project assignments and exercises
created during CS 340, taken during Fall 2024 at Brigham Young University.

## Organization

Each assignment was created independently, and is represented here as a separate branch.
The branches will not be merged together as they are mutually incompatible.

In the repo, each assignments gets its own branch with a distinct, clean folder structure.
On my local machine, each assignment is represented as a folder nested within the root folder.

### On My Local Machine

On my local machine, switching between projects is performed with a `cd` operation to a different folder.
From the root folder, new projects can be easily created
and existing projects can be pushed into the remote.

The root directory is checked out to the `main` branch.
All of the other sub-folders and noisy files are excluded from the branch
by locally excluding all files. This requires that any new files be tracked
with `git add -f FILE`.

```.gitignore
// .git/info/exclude
# In my root directory, I only want specific files added.
# The rest will be pushed on separate branches from their own folders.
# Ignore all files, only the ones I manually add
*
```

## Creating TS Projects

Leverage the [`create-ts-project.sh`](https://github.com/frozenfrank/byte-bin/blob/main/shell/create-ts-project.sh) script.
Follow the [Installation Instructions](https://github.com/frozenfrank/byte-bin/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)
to have the script added to your `$PATH` variable.

Additionally, on my local machine, I have a symlink to the script in my root directory
which provides redundant, easy access on demand.

## Pushing Assignments

Bash aliases have been created to easily add projects to this repo.
1. `source` the alias file
2. Use the functions to initially configure and upload a directory
3. After the initial setup, updates can be applied with a normal `git push` from within the folder.

Source command:

```shell
source push-assignments.aliases
```

Usage examples:

```shell
# Use to push a folder into the repo on a branch with the same name.
# Intended to be used from the direct parent of the 'git' repo.
# Usage: push-assignment hello-world-exercise
# Result: A branch in the repo named 'hello-world-exercise' with the code
push-assignment hello-world-exercise

# Use to push a directory ending in "starter-code".
# Renames the directory, and then pushes the assignment.
# Usage: push-starter-code hello-world
# Result: folder & branch named "hello-world-exercise"
push-starter-code hello-world
```
